# ðŸš€ Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) for Sensitive Analysis
The core mathematical foundation and implementation steps for using **PCE** as a **surrogate modeling** for **Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)** and **Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA)**, particularly the analytical calculation of Sobol indices, is presented below. 

## 1. Basis Function Construction and Orthogonality
